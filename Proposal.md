# Introduction

This is a brief overview of the details that will entail this entire business proposal. This is
an informative approach to the expansion of Bancroft Systems and the architecture it
requires. Information relevant to the design of the network relies on a plan to network an
entire warehouse, strengthen the security of the company, offer a solution to the
connection of two separate locations and a diagram to visualise the data retained from the
specific proposals.

# Section 1 — Wireless

Wireless networking enables the process of implementing reliable access to to the
bandwidth through accessible coverage, blockage of interferences and a cost effective
approach to the technological progress of wireless networking. The 802.11n variant is a
mechanically superior standard that offers significant bandwidth and is noted for its
compatibility between devices as it supports multiple access. In comparison to other
variants, it is more costly than its predecessors 802.11[a, b, g], however it establishes better
connection and is less costly than more recent 802.11[ac, ax, ad] variants.

The warehouse being networked requires a decent range, high speeds and low levels of
interference. The 802.11n variant coupled with the 2.4GHz band offers the flexibility and
support of several access points in a centralised location. The router should be situated
along the core of the warehouse to deliver optimised speed and low latency. An
appropriate area should be utilised to procure satisfactory coverage. This can be achieved
by mounting the access point in multiple key areas where low coverage and high
interference is not an issue. Approximately fifteen metres off the ground, the antenna will
be mounted. This will offer sufficient data range and moderately high speeds.
The 802.11n is dual-band and allows support for the 5GHz band, although sacrifices the
proper coverage of narrow areas and struggles with blockage penetration. The 2.4GHz
band significantly supports higher range, wider coverage fields and better penetration,
however it fails to maintain the speed performance of the 5GHz band, additionally
providing less bandwidth than its counterpart and allows for increased interference on the
band. The 5GHz band prioritises efficiency within a smaller area, strictly evading the
cluttering of networks and is benefited because of its minimal interference. The 2.4GHz
band facilitates a larger area within a warehouse more efficiently than the 5GHz band due
to its effective range of coverage and travelling of data, allowing for coverage outdoors
and less issues to develop.

Approximately, five to ten routers will be utilised in central localised areas, also assuming
an equal amount of access points, and the band will specifically operate on channels one,
six and eleven. The frequency ranges from 2401 — 2473 MHz [2412. 2437, 2462]. These
channels will avoid interference with one or more persons using the network, considering
its the band’s crowd and traffic performance. A lower frequency efficiently enhances the
signal and allows for longer distance and coverage in denser areas.

The 802.11n is backwards compatible with 802.11a, b, and g networks. This ensures a
broader broadcast capability and the benefit of range and speed improvement. This
wireless network is accessible and supports a wide range of technical additions. The
specific architecture should be decided through surveys and evaluation to decide the most
efficient option to deliver first-rate wireless connection at a minimal cost. A design plan is
necessary to implement the correct positions for the multiple access points to provide clear
coverage and range. The plan should advise of cabling and switches for access points and
the process for installation. The option provided is most notably an effective process to
eliminate expensive cost and maintain the consistency of speed, coverage and the blockage
of interference levels.

# Section 2 — Security

The improvement of the security within a company is an essential and vital move to
protect the assets and professional data of a company. Bancroft Systems will benefit from
crucial security assessments that will outline the security standard for strengthening its
security posture. Improvements begin by establishing the priority of a management plan
and its impact on the business. Security breaches and vulnerabilities in the network
primarily affects the infrastructure of Bancroft Systems, thereby allowing for significant
financial loss, the tainting of investments and reputation and the disclosing and loss of
confidential information and sensitive data. There are major errors in configuration and
the integration of networks within a company. This report statistically delineates points
that can support the infrastructure of the company and strive to avoid the devaluation of
Bancroft Systems.

The implementation of packet filters and proxy server firewalls is a rugged inspection for
firewall security in the prevention of access from unauthorised users. This blocks the user
from accessing private networks on the computer interface. The benefits of a network
address translation (NAT) effectively enhances the protection of private networks and IP
addresses, additionally minimising the IP address space. The necessity for intrusion
systems is essential in detecting incidents within the network and blocking threats to the
system. The IDS and IPS is in charge of security protection and would be a fundamental
addition to the security posture of Bancroft Systems. The use of authentication only allows
for permitted users to gain usage and access to the database system. This protects the
security of networks against brute force attacks through the encryption of authentication.
The development of network security services grants access to a library of clients enabled
and support imperative security features. OpenSSL is a software application utilised to
protect communication delivered through computer networks, using cryptographic
encryption. cURL is an additional software, which provides the security of data transfer
over a command line tool. To attain maximum coverage, the placement of routers is
essential within a secured place such as the CBD office. This allows for the router to only
be accessed by certain individuals, to effectively reduce the tampering of security options.
Server consolidation is required to mainly to reduce the costs against operations and
hardware. It also aids by contributing to the support of the reduction of environmental pollution. Multiple servers allows the freedom for increased services and is a cost effective
method than to only maintain a single server.

These methods reduce the risk of security within the company and should be impulsively
sought after to protect the assets of Bancroft Systems. It is necessary to evaluate security
operations and the investment for risk management and central control. An assessment
strategy should be consulted to respond to any potential security incidents. The review of
management measures and vulnerabilities is imperative to protect data and resources.
This can be achieved through the architecture of network security, to protect assets and
prevent security breaches.

# Section 3 — Wide Area Network

The usage of Wide Area Networks (WAN) is essential in connecting networks in two
separate locations. This will enhance the security of communications within Bancroft
Systems. The proposals outline the integration of connecting both location, executed by a
wireless connection with the addition of utilising a virtual private network (VPN) via sites
on the internet and a point-to-point wired connection.

# Proposal 1

A wireless connection facilitates the connection between two sites and offers the use of a
provider based VPN service to provide encryption between two sites and certify
protection of a private network. It is a less costly choice to operate and maintain a VPN
over the internet, however it arises the issues of network stability, providing medium
bandwidth and variable latency. A Network Address Translation is used for indirect
connection through private networks. It optimises the protection of the IP address on the
network and supports the WAN by usage of multiple devices on the Local Area Network
(LAN) through one shared public IP address. The private network restricts access to the
network to maintain the protection of the network. This secured network can be used to
enable a secure network traffic flow between the two sites.
Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) is necessary for traffic flow between the two sites
and it manages the fast transfer of packets within the private network. Its reliable and cost
effective maintenance is further reason for its usage and the beneficial argument for WAN
connectivity. Fibre based MPLS offers high bandwidth and low latency on the network,
which sorts data packets in an efficient manner and provides routers with the exact
location of data arrival. The cost per month retains a $1000 — $1500 AUD to use fibre
based MPLS over a WAN between two locations.

The option for a wireless connection over a WAN is a more costly choice than a wired
connection. With this statement, it involves maintenance of configurations and the overall
connection of network in the case of breakage. Operational wise, it is vital that the WAN
has great range as the need for connecting separate areas requires high speeds and power
to reduce interference. A wireless connection offers less complex accessibility and is simply
an asset towards WAN in connecting two sites. It’s worth the extra cost in the protection of
communication over the network and the masking of a shared IP address to prevent any
network breaches.

# Proposal 2

A wired ethernet connection utilises fibre cables for a stable connection within the network
system. Wired connections offer fast speeds, high connectivity, low interference and a cost
effective option to connect two sites. It sacrifices accessibility and requires consistent
maintenance to avoid the damage and transfers to time consuming repairs. This will affect
the network connection and potentially the security of the network.
Establishing a point-to-point ethernet and microwave connection supports the connection
between two sites in a quick manner. It costs approximately $600 — $800 AUD to
implement a wired connection over a WAN. Point-to-point routing is configured to use a
transmission interface and secured connection over a network only accessible through the
cable connection. Unlike wireless networks, the protection of wired connection is
maintained through the avoidance of broadcasting the network publicly.
Wired connection over a WAN between two sites provide low operational expenditure and
a low initial cost to install and use. Its security is consistent with its superiority, enabling
secure features to prevent potential breaches or attacks to the system. The transfer and
arrival of data is fast and simple through a wired connection.
